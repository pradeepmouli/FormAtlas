## Overview

.NET UI development across Blazor, MAUI, Uno Platform, WPF, WinUI 3, and WinForms. This skill covers framework selection, component architecture, XAML patterns, MVVM, platform-specific deployment, accessibility, and localization. Each framework area has a dedicated companion file with deep guidance.
