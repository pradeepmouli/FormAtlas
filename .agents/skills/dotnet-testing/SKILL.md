## Overview

Testing strategy, frameworks, and quality tooling for .NET applications. This consolidated skill spans 12 topic areas. Load the appropriate companion file from `references/` based on the routing table below.

Baseline dependency: `references/testing-strategy.md` defines the unit vs integration vs E2E decision tree and test doubles selection that inform all testing decisions. Load it by default whenever a testing approach needs to be chosen.

Most-shared companion: `references/xunit.md` covers xUnit v3 framework features used by integration, snapshot, and UI testing companions.

## Scope

- Test strategy and architecture (unit, integration, E2E)
- xUnit v3 test authoring
- Integration testing (WebApplicationFactory, Testcontainers)
- E2E browser testing (Playwright)
- Snapshot testing (Verify)
- Benchmarking (BenchmarkDotNet, CI gating)
- Quality (coverage, mutation testing)
- Cross-framework UI testing patterns
- Test scaffolding

## Out of scope

- UI framework-specific testing (bUnit, Appium) -> [skill:dotnet-ui]
- CI/CD pipeline configuration -> [skill:dotnet-devops]
- Performance profiling -> [skill:dotnet-tooling]
